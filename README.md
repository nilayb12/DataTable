A JavaScript Project to view a .csv file & apply search, sort & filter to it without modifying the source file.
Uses Datatable & PapaParse.

Note: May get stuck processing very large files (might even crash the browser with Out of Memory error), if browser doesn't crash just wait for it to start responding.
